# Implement a stack that has the following methods:
#
# push(val): push val on to the stack
# pop(): pop off and return top most element of stack. If there are no elements in the stack, throw an error.
# max(): return the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, throw an error.
#
# Each method should run in constant time
